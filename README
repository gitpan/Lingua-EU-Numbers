NAME
    Lingua::EU::Numbers - Converts numbers into Bask (Euskara).

SYNOPSIS
      # Functional interface 
      use Lingua::FR::Numbers;
      my $number = shift ;
      print "The cardinal value of $number is " . &cardinal2alpha($number) . " in Bask.\n";
      print "The ordinal value of $number is " . &ordinal2alpha($number) . " in Bask.\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This module converts numbers (cardinals and ordinals) into their Bask (Euskara) equivalent
    nouns. It accepts positive integers up to 999 billions. For info, the Bask counting system
    is vigesimal (base 20).

    The module uses the unified Bask (Euskara Batua), which sometimes varies from the Bask
    spoken in the seven Bask provinces, especially from Labourd (Lapurdi) in the Northen Bask
    Country (Ipar Euskal Herria). However, the Euskara Batua is the official Bask taught in
    Bask schools (Ikastolak) throughout the seven provinces.

    For example, the number '18' is 'hemezortzi' in Euskara Batua, while it is 'hamazortzi' in
    Lapurdi. Those who wish to use their own version of Euskara can export %num2alpha and
    modify it at their own discretion.

    All these peculiarities should not deter you from learning Euskara, which is a truly
    unique and fascinating language. A Bask legend says that even the Devil did not succeed in
    learning this language, but that should not deter you from doing so. Euskara is believed
    to be pre-Indo-European, pre-dating both Latin and the Romance languages, and if so, this
    is one of the world's most ancient languages.

    The Basques refer to themselves as Euskaldunak, or 'speakers of the Euskara'. Being part
    of the Bask Nation is a question of language, not ethnicity or place of birth. There is
    not even a word for 'being a Bask' in Euskara. So if you learn this fascinating language,
    you too can become Euskaldun!

FUNCTIONS
    cardinal2alpha($number)
        This function accepts an integer (scalar) as a parameter and returns a string (array),
        which is the noun equivalent to the cardinal number.

        It returns `undef' if the argument passed is not defined, or if the argument is not an
        integer, or if the integer passed is not comprised between zero and 999 billions.

    ordinal2alpha($number)
        This function accepts an integer (scalar) as a parameter and returns a string (array),
        which is the noun equivalent to the ordinal number.

        It returns `undef' if the argument passed is not defined, or if the argument is not an
        integer, or if the integer passed is not comprised between zero and 999 billions.

EXPORT
    This module exports by default the functions &cardinal2alpha() and &ordinal2alpha(). It
    can also export the hash %num2alpha.
